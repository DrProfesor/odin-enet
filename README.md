# odin-enet

Odin bindings for ENet networking library.

Bindings are written for our ENet fork, which contains QoL patches and enhancements. Backward compatibility with the upstream version is not guaranteed.

**NOTE:** This repo is out-of-date and requires updating to the latest Odin's version. However, due to my time constraint, I am not able to perform such an action. If you're willing to update it, I'd be happy to assist and accept any changes.

## Dependencies

* zpl-c/enet static library [GitHub link](https://github.com/zpl-c/enet) (Version **1.4.3**).

## Things to note

* Currently works only on Windows.
* Some methods lack argument names due to the ENet's API design.
